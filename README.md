Deliverable #4

Group 8: Harita Kannan, Xiaopei Wu, Lonny Strunk, Ben McCready


To run the code on Patas, enter into the base level of the directory: `$condor_submit src/D4.cmd`

The implementation of our system is in the file `src/d4/d4.py`. For this deliverable, we made improvements towards readability of summaries, and experimented with a sentence compression algorithm proposed in [Filippova (2010)](https://aclanthology.info/pdf/C/C10/C10-1037.pdf).

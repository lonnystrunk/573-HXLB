Deliverable #3

Group 8: Harita Kannan, Xiaopei Wu, Lonny Strunk, Ben McCready


To run the code on Patas, enter into the base level of the directory: `$condor_submit src/D3.cmd`

The implementation of our system is in the file `src/d3/d3.py`. For this deliverable, we added a stemmer function to customize the LexRank content selection, and experimented with two information ordering approaches: chronological ordering and greedy algorithm ordering proposed in [Nayeem and Chali (2017)](www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-2407).

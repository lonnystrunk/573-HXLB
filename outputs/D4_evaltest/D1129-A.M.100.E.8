In a story about a study suggesting vitamin D lowers cancer risk in older women, The Associated Press reported that an American Cancer Society doctor favors keeping current vitamin D guidelines of 200 to 600 international units daily.
Adequate intake of vitamin D may help prevent cancer, according to a new study.
He also said he thinks it's too early to recommend using vitamin D to prevent cancer.
Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?

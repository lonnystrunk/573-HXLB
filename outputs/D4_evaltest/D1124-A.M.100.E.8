It concludes that the quake was not to blame, mainly because two days elapsed before mud volcano erupted, and no other mud volcanoes occurred in the region after the temblor.
In December last year, President Susilo said Lapindo would pay 420 millions U.S. dollars to victims and make efforts to stop the flow of the mud.
A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, industries and fields.

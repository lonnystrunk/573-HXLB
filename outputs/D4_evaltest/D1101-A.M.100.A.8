Roberts, a 32-year-old truck driver, married with children, entered the Georgetown Amish School and took about 30 children, as well as teachers and assistants, hostage, Miller said.
On Monday morning, Charles Carl Roberts IV entered the West Nickel Mines Amish School in Lancaster County and shot 10 girls, killing five.
Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the Amish school, but police have no evidence that he actually did, State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said.

It is the second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having investments in funds managed by Madoff.
The bank said it had also invested 17 million euros of its own funds in Madoff products.
They called it the "hedge fund" floor, but federal prosecutors now say the work Madoff did there was actually a fraud scheme whose losses Madoff himself estimates at $50 billion.
While many investors were friends or met Madoff at country clubs or on charitable boards, even more had entrusted their money to professional advisory firms that, in turn, handed it on to Madoff -- for a fee.

Rescue ships collected scores of bloated corpses Monday from seas close to where an Indonesian ferry sank in the Java Sea, but search teams also spotted survivors on life rafts and dropped food and water to them, officials said.
Navy ships, fishermen and search and rescue teams have found more than 200 survivors since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 on board.

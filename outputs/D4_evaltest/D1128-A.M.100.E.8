In a pre-trial hearing of the case before the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his client was concerned he was being "short-changed" with only two attorneys who can attend his trial against a prosecution legal team of at least 10 people.
Earlier this week, the Special Court for Sierra Leone set June 4 as the start date for Taylor's trial, which is expected to take up to a year to complete.

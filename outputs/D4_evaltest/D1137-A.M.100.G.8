The crane, reaching 19 stories tall, collapsed during construction of a 43-story building on 51st Street, splitting into pieces shortly after 2 p.m., officials said.
The crane was to be extended Saturday so workers could start work on a new level of the planned 43-story building, said an owner of the company that manages the construction site.

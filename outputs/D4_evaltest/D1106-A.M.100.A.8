Japan is the world's biggest tuna consumer, eating one quarter of the global catch.
The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.

Concern has been growing about overfishing of tuna and other fish species.

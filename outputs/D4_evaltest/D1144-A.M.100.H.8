But with this week's recall of nearly a million playthings from Mattel Inc.'s Fisher-Price unit because of possible lead paint contamination, a trip to the toy store is leading Brahams and other consumers to think twice before making a purchase.
Thursday's toy recall follows the June recall by RC2 Corp. of 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway product line because of lead paint.
According to Mattel, all the toys were made by a contract manufacturer in China.

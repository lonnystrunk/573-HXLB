A rocket-propelled grenade struck the U.S. Embassy early Friday, causing limited damage and no injuries, but reviving fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups that carried out deadly strikes over three decades.
The United States heaped praise on Greek authorities for their response Friday to a rocket attack on the US embassy in Athens, a city it once considered a relatively soft target for violent extremists.
The Greek Police are working closely with the embassy authorities," a police statement said.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited the embassy after the blast.

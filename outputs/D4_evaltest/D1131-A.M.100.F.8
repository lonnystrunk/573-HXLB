The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.
Scientists warn that up to half of the world's coral reefs could disappear by 2045.
The idea is to grow coral in labs, kind of like fish farms, so they can be returned to their natural settings in Florida's struggling coral reefs.
"If we can't grow them outside of the coral reef, you're not going to get them."

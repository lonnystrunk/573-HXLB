Surgical nurse Debora Maruca-Kovac, whose family took in Hawkins after her 17- and 19-year-old sons befriended him, said she saw victims of the mall shooting being brought in to the hospital where she works.
Maruca-Kovac told the Omaha World-Herald that the night before the shooting, Hawkins and her sons showed her an SKS semiautomatic Russian military rifle -- the same type used in the shooting.
About an hour before the shooting, Hawkins called her and told her he had written a suicide note, Maruca-Kovac said.
When the shooting was over, Hawkins shot himself.

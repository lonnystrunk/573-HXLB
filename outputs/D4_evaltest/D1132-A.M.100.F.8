There have been reports of turtle deaths before, but not as many as this year, he said.
There are seven sea turtle species in the world.
The 13 Chinese were part of an original group of 19 captured by marine police on March 26 with 47 Green turtles and 29 Hawksbill turtles.
"Of the 185 Green turtles and the 89 Hawksbill turtles, 32 are still alive and we are going to release them very soon," said Mohamad Yusoff.
Rapid development endangers the turtles, too.

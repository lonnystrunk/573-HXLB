According to studies carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation and others, the pharmaceutical industry's advertising encourages some people to consult doctors, which is a good thing, particularly for those who may not have known they have, say, high cholesterol or blood pressure. But ads also persuade people to spend money on unnecessary drugs, which is a bad thing for their health and for insurance premiums. The solution is not a total ban on advertising, as some suggest, but rather more clinical trials of drugs, aimed specifically at determining effectiveness as well as long-term safety. It is in the insurance industry's interest, the FDA's interest and the federal government's interest -- because the federal government is a major provider of health insurance -- either to require drug companies to conduct such comparative tests or to set up a neutral agency to do so. If there is a lesson to be learned from the Vioxx withdrawal, surely it is the need for renewed attention to evidence-based medicine and evidence-based drug prescription as well.
In testimony before a congressional panel in mid-September, Andrew Mosholder, an FDA epidemiologist, said his bosses asked him to soften recommendations about antidepressants.
Celebrex and Vioxx have become household names in recent years. Rich Tomaselli of Advertising Age Magazine said Merck spent $78 million advertising Vioxx last year, compared to $96 million for Celebrex, the 10th most popular drug in the country. Long-term studies on Bextra, which was approved by the FDA in 2001, are not yet available.
Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, who chairs the House Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx, and whether the agency will study potential risks in similar drugs.
``There was so much denial over there,'' said David Moskowitz, senior pharmaceutical analyst for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Co.

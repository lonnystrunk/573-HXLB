President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Kong, 58, who allegedly headed a special wiretapping unit, was unconscious in hospital after stabbing himself in the stomach, Yonhap said.
Former NIS officials have told newspapers the taped conversation was authentic.
"Forgive us for the past illegal bugging ... We are now determined to start from scratch and write a new history of NIS," he said.
"Some of earlier media reports are totally groundless and distorted."

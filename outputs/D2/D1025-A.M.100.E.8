Alaskan grizzly bears, which number around 30,000, were never listed under the act.
The federal official most alarmed about the recent spike in illegal bear killings is Chris Servheen, grizzly-bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year. Moreover, new management plans might allow hunting of the bears outside the park.
The only other large population of grizzlies in the United States is in and around Glacier National Park. Small populations of bears live in the Selkirk Mountains of Idaho, the Cabinet Mountains of Montana and the Cascades of northwest Washington.
The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7 percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said. Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.

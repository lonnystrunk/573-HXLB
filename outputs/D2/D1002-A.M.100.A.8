In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have  been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics.
The officers were indicted in March. They are accused of firing  41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on Feb. 4. Diallo was hit 19 times. Attorneys for the officers said their clients mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun.
The issue of severing the cases is important because thedefendants will probably need one another's testimony tocorroborate their accounts of the shooting.
As the first gunshots rang out, McMellon fell backwards down thesteps and injured his tailbone, causing at least some of hiscolleagues to believe that he had been hit by return fire, peopleknowledgeable about the case said. Carroll moved to his right andcontinued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car,began firing as well, they said.
The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminalcharges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did nottestify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard theircase. Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killedon Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of whichhit him.

At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
An extremely powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed devastated many parts of North Sumatra and Aceh on Dec. 26 last year, killing more than 100,000 people there.

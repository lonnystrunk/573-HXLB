"I sympathize as a person with Mr Yushchenko that he is sick. I hope that he gets better soon."
Yushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned, a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once-telegenic candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.
There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
At Kiev airport, Yushchenko said it should not take too long to reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case. ``A lot of the circumstances are already known,'' he said. ``I think if the general prosecutor acts according to Ukraine's laws, both the country and the world at large will soon know who did this.''
On Friday, Yushchenko said: "It is my growing conviction that what happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician in opposition. The aim, naturally, was to kill me."

According to a survey by Asian Development Bank (ADB), Motorcyclists and pedestrians are by far the biggest proportion of those killed or injured. Many of these motorcyclist casualties could be avoided if there was widespread wearing of safety helmets.
Brad E. Kodesh, president of the A1skateboards.com Web site, which sells skateboard equipment, said he did not think the law was necessary, because "ultimately, I think, wearing a helmet is the rider's decision; it should be enforced by the parents."
The founder of a San Diego-based company called Full90 said he has sold 100,000 headgear, which resemble an enlarged headband, weigh less than 2 ounces, and cover the forehead, temples and occipital bone in back of the head. The device is made of shock-absorbing foam situated between an outer layer of Lycra and an inner layer of sweat-absorbing polypropylene. Several models are available at prices ranging from $24 to $39.
This resistance, though, has not dissuaded a small number of youth clubs from requiring the use of headgear.
This is also a moment supercharged with disagreement on whether heading of the ball can cause concussions or long-term brain impairment. Studies have presented contradictory results, and the matter remains disputed as the soccer federation undertakes a long-term examination of head injuries.

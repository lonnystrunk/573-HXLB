The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us together.''
Littleton needs comfort.
``They wanted death and destruction.
And that somehow, life keeps moving.

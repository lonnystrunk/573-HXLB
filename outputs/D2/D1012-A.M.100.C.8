There were no survivors in what officials called Greece's worst airline accident.
A spokesman for the Greek air force said the F-16s intercepted the plane at an altitude of 10,360 meters (34,000 feet).
The crash occurred on the eve of a main religious holiday in Greece and Cyprus _ a public holiday devoted to the Virgin Mary.
By Sunday afternoon, rescue workers at the site of the crash had recovered the so-called black boxes that contain recordings of flight data and the pilots' voices, said Akrivos Tsolakis, head of the Greek airline safety commission.

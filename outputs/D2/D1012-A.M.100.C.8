State-run news media reported that a malfunction in the aircraft's oxygen system might have precipitated the crash and that the cabin might have rapidly lost pressure. Many of the victims found in the sheared and burning wreckage were still wearing oxygen masks.
"Was there a general poisoning (of some kind)? That seems rather improbable because a passenger sent a text message" to a relative after the pilots apparently lost consciousness, he said.
"He told me the pilots were unconscious ... he said: "Farewell, cousin, here we're frozen."
The plane did not respond to radio calls. One of the pilots  appeared to have fallen ill or unconscious, according to reports.
Athens radio quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the plane was  being accompanied by two Greek fighter jets when it went down.

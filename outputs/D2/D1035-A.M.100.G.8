Under VA regulations, veterans do not have to prove they were  exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides containing the toxic substance dioxin.
Now, however, the Vietnamese and the American Embassy in Hanoi are both suggesting a joint study of the effects of the herbicides.
The Department of Veterans Affairs has received more than 92,000  claims and treated more than 50,000 cases of service-related conditions, spokesman Ken McKinnon said.

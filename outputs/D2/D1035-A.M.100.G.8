American herbicides, of which the most prominent was AgentOrange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supplyroutes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps,and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands. More than 10percent of the land area of South Vietnam was sprayed at leastonce, and some areas were sprayed repeatedly. The herbicidesthemselves would generally dissipate within weeks but would leavebehind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently createdduring the manufacturing process.

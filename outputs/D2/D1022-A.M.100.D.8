Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill  of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill  more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the  whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.
Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended his decision not to intercept whaling boats found in Antarctic waters, saying Japan and many other countries do not recognize Australian territorial claims in Antarctica and a whaling sanctuary that is protected under Australian law.

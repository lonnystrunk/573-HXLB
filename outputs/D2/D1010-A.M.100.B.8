In an interview in the Bulgarian newspaper Troud, the director of Bulgaria's laboratory for detecting mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Raiko Pechev said the Dutch test was "more precise, more rapid" than tests already approved by the EU and "is in its last stage of EU pre-certification trials".
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
In addition, the U.S. government has adopted stricter slaughtering techniques to prevent possible infection, Chen added.
As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the agency said in a news release. The target was 8,000 cattle tested by the end of 2004. All results came back negative for the disease.
An EU ban on British beef and widespread cattle culls followed the 1996 alert, but by then the disease had spread to other countries.

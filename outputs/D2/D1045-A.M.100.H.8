The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River  on Wednesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in Beijing on Thursday that China has informed Russia of the water pollution situation in the river, a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian  far east and China.
"After the explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company under  China National Petroleum Corporation, our observation showed  pollutants containing benzene had flown into the Songhua River and caused water pollution," said an official with SEPA.
He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is  expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur  River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days  judging from the current flow speed.
At another press conference Thursday, a senior official with  China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said  the Chinese side will keep informing the Russian side of what it  has learnt from our monitoring.
The front of the polluted water of  Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of  Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local  environment authority said.

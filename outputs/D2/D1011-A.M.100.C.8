The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said. Results are anticipated next year. It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes the drug.
But psychiatrists would say that neither one falls into the strict definition of anorexia nervosa, the most severe eating disorder, or its relative, bulimia nervosa. According to the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least twice a week, on average.
Bulimia, which like anorexia is predominantly contracted by  women, is a virtual food obsession that leads to eating binges  followed by acts to make up for it like self-induced vomiting or  excessive exercise.

"You didn't hear anything about it in schools. You heard about safe sex, drugs, AIDS ... but you never heard anything about eating disorders. That's when I decided to start Lifelines."

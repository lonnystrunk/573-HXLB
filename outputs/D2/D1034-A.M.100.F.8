She had some qualms complying with Johnson's second request _ catch the frog, euthanize it in her freezer and send it to the university after preserving it in alcohol.
``We've had a leap in our understanding into the causes of amphibian decline,'' said Rick Kearney, national coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey's amphibian research and monitoring initiative. ``We recognize how there are connections between the decline in water quality (and availability) and amphibians. ... Amphibians are a very important indicator of our environmental quality.''
The authors attributed some of the declines, which have occurred mainly in tropical areas, to habitat loss or to humans collecting animals for food, medicine, or pets.
Humans are responsible for amphibians' decline in other regions of the world, including China, where many are sought as a delicacy. The Chinese giant salamander -- at six feet the largest amphibian in the world -- sells for at least $300 on the street and makes for several meals, and it has now disappeared from nearly all its range.
"It starts us thinking that we should be paying attention to these because parallel things could happen in humans," Hammerson said.

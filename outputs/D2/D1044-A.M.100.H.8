The agency also asked local inspectors to check domestic food  makers to ensure their products or raw materials are free of the  dye.
The red-colored dye, which is used for coloring industrial  products such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make  Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide  range of products.
The director of Food Standard Agency (FSA) David Statham said  in a statement that "local authorities across the country have  visited a number of premises to look at records and take samples," adding that "this is a major investigation".
Under British law, companies and their executives could face  prosecution, unlimited fines and two years in prison, for failure to  ensure that food placed on the market is safe and fit for human  consumption.
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of  cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the  concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.

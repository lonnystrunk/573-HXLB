The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
After the tsunami, authorities in Tamil Nadu state launched a massive forestation program along the coast. The program aims to involve fishermen's families in growing and preserving forests. Officials have asked fishing families to plant a sapling and dedicate it to a family member who died in the disaster.
Regional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia with the IUCN (World Conservation Union) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Jerker Tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be "very, very serious."
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where  river deltas provide lots of sediment. Its roots collect sediments and slow the water's flow, helping to protect the coastline and  preventing erosion. Over time, the roots can collect enough debris and mud to extend the edge of the coastline further out.
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.

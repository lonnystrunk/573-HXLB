Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui. Clashes between troops and tribesmen demanding more returns from the natural resources extracted on their territory are common. Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising  which was brutally put down by the government.
Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region. Attacks against government targets are common in many parts of the province and have grown in intensity this year.
No government official was immediately available Friday to answer Mengal's claim. On Thursday, Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told Parliament in Islamabad, "There were some casualties, but it is wrong to say that 40 or 70 people were killed."

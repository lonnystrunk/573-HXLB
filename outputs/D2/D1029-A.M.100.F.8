During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
"The situation in Dera Bugti is very tense.
They want to loot our resources," he said.
A cease-fire has been holding since early Friday.

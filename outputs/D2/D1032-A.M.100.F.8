Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface," said Terje Overvik, executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the well.
Snorre A, a steel tension-leg platform, was shut down Nov. 28 after a gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180 workers. The shutdown of Snorre and the Vigdis field meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil a day in production, or 6.4 percent of Norway's roughly 3.2 million barrels a day of production.

"We do not want to speculate on when we can resume production," Hetland said.

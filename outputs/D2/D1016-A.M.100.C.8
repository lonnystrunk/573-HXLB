Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldestdaughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, Idon't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts atforeign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
Djuhad Mahja SH of the United Development Party faction madethe statement in the Parliament building here Thursday.
A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalibsaid without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
"We would not take the initiative (to launch theinvestigation), it has to come from the country of origin of theperson (suspected of having illegally-gained deposits)," he added.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thoroughinvestigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends,the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changedits position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.

Van der Sloot, from Holland, is training to be a judge in Aruba, a Dutch Caribbean island.
The judge in the case, Bob Kit, will decide by Sunday whether there is enough evidence to keep them in jail. No one has been charged in the case, and lawyers for all three men say they are innocent.
Aruba follows Dutch law as a former colony in the Netherlands Antilles, from which it seceded in 1986 to become an independent member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.
Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen, according to a friend who helped with the search.

Matuszeski, the bay program's leader from 1991 to 2001, said officials knew their work would revolve around renovating sewage plants and keeping farm manure out of streams.
But first, the bay cleanup bureaucracy worked on official water standards -- figuring out exactly how clean the bay should be. That process was supposed to take one year. It took three, with Washington, the states and the federal government spending a combined $1 billion a year.
Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered tradition. For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters. For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the world.
The events spotlighting oysters in October and November unfold like oysters on the half shell -- by the dozen. There are Tilghman Island Day, the J. Millard Tawes Oyster and Bull Roast in Crisfield, the St. Michaels Oysterfest, the Urbanna Oyster Festival, and the biggest pearl of them all for oyster lovers _the St. Mary's County Oyster Festival this weekend, home to the National Oyster Shucking Championship and National Oyster Cook-Off Contest. The festival features oysters in every imaginable combination: raw, steamed, fried or Rockefeller; stewed in chowder or mixed with cocktail sauce; or served with a swig of beer in a shot glass.

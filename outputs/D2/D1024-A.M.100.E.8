About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at theentrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say madepharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover forthe making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles of water on the muddyground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.
According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, thefactory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinarymedicines. A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people woundedfrom the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them werecritically hurt, he said. The plant does not operate at night andthere were apparently few workers around during the attack.
But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said hebelieved the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden hasnever built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL;
Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant wasa cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here,even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particularfactory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.
At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinskywere on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and hismistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society asthe ultimate mockery.

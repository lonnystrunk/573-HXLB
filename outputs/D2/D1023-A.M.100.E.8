Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian authorities turned a military barracks compound into an avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies.
Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border, where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of snow and rubble for survivors.
``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and wreckage,'' Schoenherr said.

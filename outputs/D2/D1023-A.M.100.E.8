LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Helicopters rescued stranded tourists in  western Austria and another killer avalanche brought new heartache today. The new avalanche struck just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where a dead woman and three survivors were pulled from the snow and debris. Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency said. Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche yesterday.

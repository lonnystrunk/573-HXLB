After the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed.
The instrument's readings showed that the site of the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several hundred feet underground.
It indicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a shallower one perhaps a mile below the crater.
Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.
Major compared Friday's ``small explosive eruption'' to the activity that came to be regarded as normal in the six years after the 1980 eruption.

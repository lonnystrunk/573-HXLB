Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of  dinosaurs, are cited as a "national gem" of China. The Qinling  pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about  50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
In Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant  pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming.
The province's efforts have paid off. The latest national  survey on giant panda, which was organized by the State Forestry  Administration, showed that the population and habitat of the  pandas in Sichuan have both increased 30 percent during the past  seven years.
Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas  protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.
China has applied to the United  Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern  Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the  endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.

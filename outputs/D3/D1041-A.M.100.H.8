In Sri Lanka and Thailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have crashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of years old, apart.
For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.

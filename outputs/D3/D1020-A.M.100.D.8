This is the third major recall in a month of meat products.
Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with  illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country have had to recall products after tests detected listeria.
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, said that on Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators isolated this strain of Listeria on an open package of hot dogs that a month earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill.

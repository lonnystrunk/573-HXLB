This is the third major recall in a month of meat products.
Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with  illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country have had to recall products after tests detected listeria.
Bil Mar Foods Co., a meat processor owned by Sara Lee in  Zeeland, Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and cold cuts after a rare strain of the listeria bacteria was found in both opened and unopened packages.

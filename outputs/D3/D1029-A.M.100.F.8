Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the country.
"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the government will give full response," he said.
Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti.

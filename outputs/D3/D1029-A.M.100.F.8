Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the country.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation.

Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October  that police said was motivated in part because he was gay.
(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard will begin with jury selection March 24.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  not participate in Shepard's beating.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.

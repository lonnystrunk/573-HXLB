``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold.

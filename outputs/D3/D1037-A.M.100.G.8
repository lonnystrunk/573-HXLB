The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
A decision about whether to introduce a new species of Chinese oyster into the Chesapeake Bay has been put off a few months longer because of delays in a scientific study, Maryland officials say.
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay.

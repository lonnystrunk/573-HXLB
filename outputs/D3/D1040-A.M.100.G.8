Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley.
Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
Blake, 71, is accused of murdering Bakley less than six months after their marriage.
Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.

Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
In his argument, Schwartzbach responded that Blake parked the car under a street light.
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Samuels cautioned the jury not to judge Blake based on Bakley's past.
And when that failed, Samuels said, Blake tried repeatedly to solicit others to kill Bakley.

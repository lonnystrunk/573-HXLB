Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.
In his argument, Schwartzbach responded that Blake parked the car under a street light.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.

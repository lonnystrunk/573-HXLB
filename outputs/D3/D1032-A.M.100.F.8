Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained "unclear" when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week.

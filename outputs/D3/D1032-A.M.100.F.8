Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.
Statoil did not say when it expected to resume production at its Snorre A platform, noting that a permanent cap had not been put in place.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.

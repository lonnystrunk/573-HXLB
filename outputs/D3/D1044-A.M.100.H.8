Meanwhile the European Commission, reporting the results of a two-day meeting on the British scare, revealed that the batch of potentially cancer-causing Sudan I dye at the root of the concern came from India.
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.

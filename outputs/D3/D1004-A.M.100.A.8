Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft currently in PNG on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's remote north.
"Prime Minister Bill Skate has directed that immediate action be taken to arrange urgent supplies of food, water, shelter and cooking utensils while detailed assessments and reports are being prepared," Robert Igara, chief secretary of the PNG government, said Saturday in a statement, Australian Associated Press reported.

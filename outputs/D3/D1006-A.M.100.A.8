The FDA said last week after Vioxx was withdrawn that the problems were unique to that drug.
Information from the earlier study went on the Vioxx label in April 2002, according to the FDA.
With Vioxx, researchers had been warning about the drug's possible cardiovascular risks since 2000, only a year after it was approved by the FDA.
Merck removed Vioxx from sale Sept. 28 after seeing an increased risk of "serious cardiovascular events," the FDA said, including heart attacks and strokes.

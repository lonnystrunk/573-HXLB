The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is only found in poultry.

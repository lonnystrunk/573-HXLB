Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

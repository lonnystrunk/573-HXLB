Joran remains in police custody with two other young men in the May 30 disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
Van der Sloot described dancing with Holloway at the bar and said "she wanted to go with me" at closing time, according to Bearman.

Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, England replied: "He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size."
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
England has yet to be sentenced by the military court hearing her case.
Two people close to the prosecution have said England can expect to receive no more than 30 months in prison.

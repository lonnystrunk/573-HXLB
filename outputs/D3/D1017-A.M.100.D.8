NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very  dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
``We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that.''
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.

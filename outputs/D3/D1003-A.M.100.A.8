The Baishuijiang preserve and local governments have enhanced education about giant panda protection and asked locals not to harm the animals if hungry giant pandas enter villages to look for food.
The Qinling pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
The latest national survey on giant panda, which was organized by the State Forestry Administration, showed that the population and habitat of the pandas in Sichuan have both increased 30 percent during the past seven years.

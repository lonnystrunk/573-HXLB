"We will definitely first consider the panda natural reserves when planning how to use the money," said the official.
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
The bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas.
The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages.

Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination.

The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.

Ireland banned the use of meat and bone meal as cattle feed, the suspected origin of mad cow disease, in 1990.
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.

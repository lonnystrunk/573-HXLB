A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons.
About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.
``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.

``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.
About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.

He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.

The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.

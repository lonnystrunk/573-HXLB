The potentially explosive case came to light when a tape of a wiretapped conversation in 1997 between Hong and a top Samsung official was leaked to the press last week.
A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.

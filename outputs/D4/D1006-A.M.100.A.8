With Vioxx, researchers had been warning about the drug's possible cardiovascular risks since 2000, only a year after it was approved by the FDA.
The FDA safety officer in charge of the report, David Graham, concluded that Vioxx posed much greater cardiovascular risk than the other major drug in its class, Celebrex.
Merck removed Vioxx from sale Sept. 28 after seeing an increased risk of "serious cardiovascular events," the FDA said, including heart attacks and strokes.

Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
And when that failed, Samuels said, Blake tried repeatedly to solicit others to kill Bakley.
Samuels cautioned the jury not to judge Blake based on Bakley's past.

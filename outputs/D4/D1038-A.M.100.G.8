Scientists cannot say whether the volcano will now calm down or whether more eruptions will occur.
Norton said the chances of an eruption or lava flow have increased, and that the volcano most likely will see moderate ash eruptions.
After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been rumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting that pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.
The instrument's readings showed that the site of the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several hundred feet underground.

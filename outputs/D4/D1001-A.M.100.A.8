Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m.
The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the students of Columbine, Gore said.

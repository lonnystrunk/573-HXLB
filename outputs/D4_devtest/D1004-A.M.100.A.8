Australia Sunday sent three Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night.
Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out, and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
A 10-meter tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 km north of PNG's capital city of Port Moresby.

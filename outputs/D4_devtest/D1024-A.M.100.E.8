In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.''

Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence.

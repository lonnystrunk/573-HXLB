For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.

More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.

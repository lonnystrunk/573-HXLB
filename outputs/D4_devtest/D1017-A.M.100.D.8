Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous Category 4 storm.
``We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that.''

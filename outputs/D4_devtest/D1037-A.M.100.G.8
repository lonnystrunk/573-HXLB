The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
But some oysters do survive in the bay.
The bay needs oysters.
There were once almost 2,000 of the boats working the bay, but today, they number near 30, with only about 10 used for oystering.

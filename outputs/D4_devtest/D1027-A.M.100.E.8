Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October that police said was motivated in part because he was gay.

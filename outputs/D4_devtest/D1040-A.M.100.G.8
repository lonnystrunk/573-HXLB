Samuels cautioned the jury not to judge Blake based on Bakley's past.
And when that failed, Samuels said, Blake tried repeatedly to solicit others to kill Bakley.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
